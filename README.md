##Developer Description:
This project representing a MEAN Stack CRUD Application.
It is a cinema system that consumes api in order to add & remove casts,movies, and assign cast model to a movie model and vice versa
The adding and removing of models can only be done by admin after login to admin panel; note that the admin panel is integrated in same application for practice purposes only.
For clients, there is nothing much yet to show, the interface will show them the movies and casts that are represented in the system.
This application is still under progress many ideas would be rendered to it with time, and my objective is to make it an interacting apllication with clients too, not only with admins.

The application is written using angular;with help of express api developed in typescript; it contaions many concepts of angular such as services,lazy loading,componatizing html template,linking to express api, Observer and Observable pattern using Subjects and Subscriptions and much more...

it is important to mention that I didn't design the interface,rather I convert a web template to an angular web app.
